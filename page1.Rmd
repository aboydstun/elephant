```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Only install packages once
#install.packages("plotly")

# Interactive Plot

# Put echo=FALSE for no code
# Or you can put eval=FALSE if you want to show the code but not run it.


```


```{r plotlycars,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist, color=speed)) + geom_line() + geom_point(alpha=0.5)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
